      "The Balances pallet example of storing the balance of an account.\n\nExample\n\nnocompile impl pallet_balances::Config for Runtime { type AccountStore = StorageMapShim<Self::Account<Runtime>, frame_system::Provider<Runtime>, AccountId, Self::AccountData<Balance>> }\n\nYou can also store the balance of an account in the System pallet.\n\nExample\n\nnocompile impl pallet_balances::Config for Runtime { type AccountStore = System }\n\nBut this comes with tradeoffs, storing account balances in the system pallet stores frame_system data alongside the account data contrary to storing account balances in the Balances pallet, which uses a StorageMap to store balances data only. NOTE: This is only used in the case that this pallet is used to store balances."
